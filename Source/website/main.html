		<p>This application is designed to be used by parents to monitor their 
		child's performance and behavior.</p>
		<p>Both the parent and child download the application on their 
		Android devices. They each create accounts and then they are linked.</p>
		
		<h3>Students</h3>
		<p>The student will only be able to view their assignments and attendance,
		and to receive notifications of upcoming assignments and tests.</p>
		<p>There will be a secondary password to prevent the child from uninstalling
		the application without their parent's permission.</p>
		
		<h3>Parents</h3>
		<p>Parents can also view their child's assignments and attendance. 
		However, the parent will also gain access to data on the child's phone.
		As the student misses or fails assignments, skips class, or is late for class,
		the parent will gain more features.</p>
		<p>At Level 1, the parent will only be able to see the assignments and attendance.</p>
		<p>At Level 2, the parent will also be able to block applications on the child's device.</p>
		<p>At Level 3, the parent will also be able to track the child's location using the GPS coordinates of the device.</p>
		<p>At Level 4, the parent will also be able to view the child's text messages.</p>
		
		<h3>Teachers</h3>
		<p>The teachers will not have access to any confidential information that the parents do,
		but they will be the ones uploading new assignments and marking attendance.</p>
		
		<h3>And hey, a video!</h3>
		<p>If you don't control your child they will turn into something like this, that
		laughs at pure destruction.</p>
